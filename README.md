Shut Up I'm Working

As agencies/freelancers work with clients one big sticking point is that the clients have no idea what is getting done. This requires the developer to pull himself away from the project go to an email and write a fancy email telling them what was updated. ShutUpImWorking runs in the background and is linked to your Slack and Git. So when you commit an update to Git, the software will automatically send a slack message or email to the client to tell them what work is done. No longer are you distracted by updating clients, focus on the work and communicate in an easy way that does not distract your workflow.
